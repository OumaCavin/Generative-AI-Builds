This is a simple **AI-powered number guessing game** built with **JAC language**.  
It demonstrates how to progressively learn Jac concepts while integrating **Gemini (Google AI Studio)** through **LiteLLM** and **BLLM**.

---

## üöÄ Features
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step progression from Python ‚Üí Jac (Steps 0‚Äì6).  
- ‚úÖ Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for AI-powered hints.  
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.).  
- ‚úÖ Shows how to save API keys permanently (Linux/macOS + Windows).

## üì¶ Requirements


Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12+  
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or `pip`  
- jaclang, byllm
- A valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable 

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install jaclang jaseci jaseci-ai-tools litellm bllm
````

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Jac and bllm

```bash
pip install jaclang
pip install bllm
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get a Gemini API Key

1. Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**
2. Create a new project.
3. Generate a new API key under **"API Keys"**.
4. Copy your key (e.g., `AIzaSy...`).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Export API Key

#### üîë API Key Setup (Gemini ‚Äì Google AI Studio)

We use the **Gemini API key** (AI Studio) for authentication.

#### Temporary (session only)

Linux/macOS:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

#### Permanent Setup

##### Linux/macOS

Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`):

```bash
echo 'export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

##### Windows

In PowerShell:

```powershell
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

Restart your terminal to apply the change.

‚úÖ Verify with:

```bash
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY   # Linux/macOS
echo %GEMINI_API_KEY%  # Windows (cmd)
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Update Model in JAC

In `guess_game6.jac`, we use Gemini 2.5 Flash:

```jac
# ‚úÖ Update (Gemini AI Studio)
glob llm = Model(model_name="gemini/gemini-2.5-flash", verbose=False);
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If you use `gemini-2.5-flash` (without the `gemini/` prefix), LiteLLM assumes **Vertex AI** and requires GCP setup.
Always use the `gemini/` prefix for AI Studio.

## ‚ö° Notes & Troubleshooting

* If you get `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`: check your API key is set correctly.
* If you get `404 NOT_FOUND`: ensure you‚Äôre using a valid **model name** from AI Studio (`gemini/gemini-2.5-flash`).
* If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google'`, you likely tried Vertex AI. Stick to AI Studio API key instead.
